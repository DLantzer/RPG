I.PSI Moves
---------------------
 
 -OFFENSE

     -PK Love
      (aka PSI Rockin in EarthBound)
      NOTE: The name of this attack will be whatever you entered as your
            "favorite thing" at the very beginning of the game.

      This is Lucas's special PSI attack. Each version of this attack is
      learned when you reach a certain point in the game. It is a powerful move
      that inflicts a significant amount of damage to all enemies on screen,
      but it consumes quite a bit of PP.

     
      Alpha

       PP Cost: 10
       Damage: 120~160 HP

      Beta

       PP Cost: 20
       Damage: 220~260 HP

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 35
       Damage: 430~500 HP

      Omega

       PP Cost: 50
       Damage: 800~860 HP


     -PK Flash

      PP Cost: 12

      This attack randomly causes uncontrollable crying, feeling strange,
      paralysis, or instant defeat. Lucas learns this move when you reach a
      certain point in the game, and there is only one version of this attack.

    

     -PK Starstorm

      PP Cost: 48
      Damage: 650~750 HP

      This is Kumatora's equivalent of PK Love, and she learns it when you
      complete a particular chapter. It inflicts damage to all enemies on
      screen, and it is slightly weaker than Lucas's PK Love[omega]. There is
      only one version of this attack.
   

     -PK Fire

      This attack causes fire damage to all enemies on screen. It's
      effectiveness varies depending on the target, as some enemies are
      vulnerable to it, while others are resistant or completely immune. It is
      mostly useful when fighting a group of enemies or bosses that are weak
      against fire. This attack will occasionally cause its targets to catch on
      fire (damage of about 4% of max HP per round). Organic and Organic
      Chimera type enemies tend to be susceptible to this attack.

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 6
       Level Learned: Kumatora (10)
       Damage: 35~50 HP for neutral targets
               80~110 HP for vulnerable targets

      Beta

       PP Cost: 12
       Level Learned: Kumatora (23)
       Damage: 75~90 HP for neutral targets
               150~180 HP for vulnerable targets

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 20
       Level Learned: Kumatora (43)
       Damage: 120~150 HP for neutral targets
               230~280 HP for vulnerable targets

      Omega

       PP Cost: 40
       Level Learned: Kumatora (53)
       Damage: 160~200 HP for neutral targets
               340~380 HP for vulnerable targets


   -PK Freeze

      This attack deals ice damage to a single enemy. It's effectiveness varies
      depending on the target, as some enemies are vulnerable to it, while
      others are resistant or completely immune. Because of its relatively low
      PP cost and potentially high damage, Freeze is quite useful against both
      normal enemies and some bosses. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 5
       Level Learned: Kumatora (10)
       Damage: 80~100 HP for neutral targets
               150~180 HP for vulnerable targets

      Beta

       PP Cost: 10
       Level Learned: Kumatora (28)
       Damage: 120~150 HP for neutral targets
               230~250 HP for vulnerable targets

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Kumatora (38)
       Damage: 170~200 HP for neutral targets
               370~440 HP for vulnerable targets

      Omega

       PP Cost: 28
       Level Learned: Kumatora (51)
       Damage: 230~270 HP for neutral targets
               500~610 HP for vulnerable targets


     -PK Thunder

      Depending on what version of this attack you use, this move will summon
      one to four lightning bolts that either strike a random enemy or hit
      nothing at all. Its effectiveness varies depending on the target, as some
      enemies are vulnerable to it, while others are resistant or immune.
      
      

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 7
       Level Learned: Kumatora (13)
       Effect: summons one bolt
       Damage: 60~80 HP for neutral targets
               110~150 HP for vulnerable targets

      Beta

       PP Cost: 15
       Level Learned: Kumatora (32)
       Effect: summons two bolts
       Damage: 60~80 HP for neutral targets
               110~150 HP for vulnerable targets

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 21
       Level Learned: Kumatora (49)
       Effect: summons three bolts
       Damage: 100~160 HP for neutral targets
               180~210 HP for vulnerable targets

      Omega

       PP Cost: 32
       Level Learned: Kumatora (57)
       Effect: summons four bolts
       Damage: 100~160 HP for neutral targets
               180~210 HP for vulnerable targets


     -PK Ground

      PP Cost: 43
      Level Learned: Kumatora (60)
      Effect: causes five randomly targeted hits
      Damage: 7~10% of max HP

      The last PSI move Kumatora is likely to learn is also a rather unusual
      one. This attack will cause five randomly targeted hits. These hits will
      never miss unless you are fighting a flying enemy, so all five hits will
      target a single enemy if you are fighting only one. Each hit takes away
      roughly 7~10% of the target's max HP.
     

 -RECOVER

    -Lifeup

      Food items play an important role in this game, but after awhile you will
      likely start phasing out the use of food items in favor of Lifeup.
      Recovery is absolutely essential in staying alive in this game, and
      nothing is better or more convenient to that end than Lifeup.


      Alpha

       PP Cost: 5
       Level Learned: Lucas (n/a)
                      Kumatora (13)
       Recovery: 60~70 HP

      Beta

       PP Cost: 9
       Level Learned: Lucas (17)
                      Kumatora (31)
       Recovery: 120~150 HP

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 16
       Level Learned: Lucas (43)
       Recovery: max HP

      Omega

       PP Cost: 28
       Level Learned: Lucas (50)
       Recovery: 240~260 HP to all


     -Healing

      Almost all status effects in this game can be cured by Healing, but be
      careful when you use this move. If you use Healing as soon as a party
      member gets a status effect in the middle of battle, an enemy may cause
      the same status effect again and you will have wasted one of your turns.
      Often times, it is better to focus on attacking and use Healing after the
      battle is over. A few status effects, such as solidification, cannot be
      cured by Healing.

     

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 4
       Level Learned: Lucas (n/a)
                      Kumatora (14)
       Effect: removes one status effect

      Beta

       PP Cost: 8
       Level Learned: Lucas (25)
       Effect: removes all status effects

      Gamma

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Lucas (39)
       Effect: removes all status effects and revives battle weary party
               members with full HP

      Omega

       PP Cost: 30
       Level Learned: Lucas (56)
       Effect: removes all status effects from the entire party and revives
               party members with full HP


     -Refresh

      PP Cost: 20
      Level Learned: Lucas (58)
      Effect: the entire party recovers 10% of their max HP each turn for five
              turns

      This is a recovery move Lucas is likely to learn near the end of the
      game. In most games I would not use a move like this too much, but
      because of Mother 3's rolling HP counter, this move can potentially save
      a party member's life.


      PSI Magnet

      This move allows Kumatora to take away an enemy's PP and add it to her
      own. It is usually not necessary to use this move, since there are ample
      hot springs and Amazing Capsules in the game. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 0
       Effect: drains 2~8 PP from a single target and adds it to your own

      Omega

       PP Cost: 0
       Level Learned: Kumatora (45)
       Effect: drains 2~8 PP from all enemies and adds it to your own



 -ASSIST

      -Shield

      This move will reduce the damage inflicted by physical attacks by 50%. It
      can withstand up to three hits before it disappears. Shield can be very
      useful against strong bosses and in long battles. Using this move in
      conjunction with Defense Up or Offense Down can reduce the damage the
      party receives by a substantial amount and turn a difficult fight into an
      easy one. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 6
       Level Learned: Lucas (22)
       Effect: protects a single party member with a shield

      Omega

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Lucas (35)
       Effect: protects the entire party


      -Counter

      This move is identical to Shield, only it also reflects any inflicted
      damage back at the enemy. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 12
       Effect: protects a single party member

      Omega

       PP Cost: 28
       Level Learned: Lucas (51)
       Effect: protects the entire party


    -Psycho-Shield

      Psycho-Shield reduces the amount of damage inflicted by PSI attacks by
      50%. It can withstand up to three hits before it disappears. This move
      will probably not get as much use as the regular Shield, but it can be
      useful in a few boss battles. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 8
       Level Learned: Lucas (28)
       Effect: protects a single party member

      Omega

       PP Cost: 20
       Level Learned: Lucas (45)
       Effect: protects the entire party


     -Psycho-Counter

      This move is identical to the Psycho-Shield, only it reflects any
      inflicted damage back at the enemy. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Lucas (33)
       Effect: protects a single party member

      Omega

       PP Cost: 34
       Level Learned: Lucas (53)
       Effect: protects the entire party


     -Offense Up

      This move will increase its target's Offense by about 20% the first time,
      8% the second and third times, and 0% thereafter. It can make a pretty
      big difference in the amount of damage you inflict, especially if you are
      able to compound the increase with combos. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 6
       Effect: increases Offense of one party member

      Omega

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Lucas (36)
       Effect: increases Offense of entire party


     -Defense Up

      This move will increase its target's Defense by about 20% the first time,
      8% the first and second times, and 0% thereafter. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 6
       Effect: increases Defense of one party member

      Omega

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Lucas (30)
       Effect: increases Defense of entire party


     -Hypnosis

      This move, when successful, will put an enemy to sleep. Sleep can be
      useful if you want to hear the rhythm of the battle music or want to take
      an enemy out of a fight while fighting a group.

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 6
       Level Learned: Kumatora (21)
       Effect: targets a single enemy

      Omega

       PP Cost: 18
       Level Learned: Kumatora (36)
       Effect: targets all enemies on screen


     -Paralysis

      This move, when successful, will paralyze an enemy. While paralyzed, an
      enemy may occasionally fail to attack and waste a turn. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 8
       Effect: targets a single enemy

      Omega

       PP Cost: 24
       Level Learned: Kumatora (29)
       Effect: targets all enemies on screen


     -Brainshock

      This move, when successful, will make enemies feel strange. Enemies that
      feel strange may attack itself or its cohorts, but its occurrence is
      completely random. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 7
       Level Learned: Kumatora (25)
       Effect: targets a single enemy

      Omega

       PP Cost: 22
       Level Learned: Kumatora (47)
       Effect: targets all enemies on screen


     -Offense Down

      This move, when successful, will reduce the enemy's Offense by about 20%
      the first time, 8% the second and third times, and 0% thereafter. 

      Alpha

       PP Cost: 7
       Effect: targets a single enemy

      Omega

       PP Cost: 20
       Level Learned: Kumatora (37)
       Effect: targets all enemies on screen


     -Defense Down

      This move, when successful, will reduce the enemy's Defense by about 20%
      the first time, 8% the second and third times, and 0% thereafter.
